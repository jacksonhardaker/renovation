<div id='000'></div>

## Pre-start date

- Digger delivered
- Patio stones removed
- Fence/gate removed

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ This was done while we were out in St Louis. Strange to come back and have a segment of the fence just removed, with all the patio stones simply gone. The fence/gate parts were pushed to the back of the property to reuse later. Boden loved playing in the dirt though.

## Day 1 - 1/8/22

- Ripped up the asphalt driveway
- Tore down the side entrance
- Leveled the patio area

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Natalie:_ They ripped up the asphalt on the driveway, tore down the side entrance steps, and leveled the area that used to be the backyard patio. Big piles of debris; a mountain of broken earth & rocks are left to be scooped up.

## Day 2 - 2/8/22

- Loaded asphalt debris into the skip
- Skip was taken away
- Ripped out bilco door, stairs, and cinder block walls
- Dug a deep hole for part of the basement foundation
- Delivered a bulldozer
- Ordered the portaloo

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Natalie:_ Using the digger, they scoop the asphalt debris into a large dump that was delivered at 8am. There's a lot of dust and we're sneezing. Over the course of the day, they demolished the basement Bilco door & stairs and created a large trough reaching back into the property. The boys stood in it at the end of the day and sides came up over Jackson's head.

_Jackson:_ There looks to be the reminants of an old ceramic drain pipe stretching the length of the hole. I wonder what it was for? There's so much dirt piled up it's hard to get to the back of our yard without clambering over things. After they finished for the day, we went out our basement door, which now sits about a meter above the bottom of the pit.

## Day 3 - 3/8/22

- Dump truck arrived to start hauling dirt away
- Portaloo delivered
- Much more of the foundation hole was dug, roughly an 'L' shape

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ The hole is **huge**. Started stressing out that it was representative of the eventual size of the extension, however it sounds like they're digging at least several feet extra in all directions. I guess it makes it easier to form the foundation. There was good news regarding the dirt dumping: Apparently the usually have to drive the truck all the way to Poughkeepsie to dump the dirt, however it just so happens that a local electrician who was working nearby needs a canyon on his property filled, so they only have to haul it there. Score!

_Natalie:_ A big dump truck came at 7:30am and the digger immediately started to shovel the mountain of dirt into the dump: Big job. The shadow of the digger swept across the kitchen all morning. 2 man operation around 1pm.: one moving huge piles of dirt via front loader to the dump truck down the driveway while the other digs and digs in the back!

## Day 4 - 4/8/22

- Continued digging, and finished the hole for the main extension
- They'll tidy that, and have the foundation poured and then move on to digging for the mud room, since there's not enough space to do them concurrently
- Discovered the old well to the house
- Ripped out the step just outside the basement door
- We showed our neighbours around the pit

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ Arrived at 7:15am, got started soon after. A lot of the same today. Were told we have to have money available for the foundation guy on monday, cash. Paying cash gives us a good discount.

_Natalie:_ Finished the hole! They built a ramp to the bottom where we promptly went once they were gone. Standing at the bottom we discovered they'd uncovered a well -so coll! Catherine, Larry and Jenni came over to see the pit as well. We all amrvelled at the walls of dirt going over our heads. No discoveries of hidden treasures, though. No glass bottles, crockery or anything other than a little garbage and rocks.

## Day 5 - 5/8/22

- A couple of guys game to look around in the pit first thing, no action after that
- The digger was back at it for a couple of hours in the afternoon to tidy things up in preparation for next week

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Natalie:_ Quiet today - wasn't util 2:30 that anyone showed up to do anything. Ted says they only need to "clean up" and prep for the groundwork that needs to be in for the foundation coming in next week.

## Day 6 - 6/8/22

- Didn't expect them on a Saturday, but arrived around 8 and got to work smoothing out the pit

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ It's dry so you can clearly see where the old well was. Pretty cool! The pit looks smooth and ready to go to me, but what do I know?

_Natalie:_ Boris showed up and dithered in the back a bit. He flattened the surfaces with the digger for a while in prep for Monday.

## Day 7 - 8/8/22

- Bunch of dudes showed up early, looked like they were planning
- Laid the wooden templates for the base of the foundation, laid rebar
- Excavator was picked up, and the skid steer dropped off again
- Bit of tidy up on the driveway

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ I don't know anything about the templates, but it seems like they've boxed in the outer edges of the new extension, while leaving the base of the existing house alone. There must be a reason, but I don't know what. Maybe it's just not necessary?

_Natalie:_ Some big, beefy guys came and laid out wooden boards and metal rods for a mold of what looks like the base of our foundation and walls. Exciting to see the outline of the house!

<div id='008'></div>

## Day 8 - 9/8/22

- More fussing with the drive. The ramp down to the pit is now shorter and steeper
- Electrician came by to look at the plans/basement
- Pouring of the foundation kicks off tomorrow, in the following order:
  - Concrete poured into the templates for the footing
  - Interior filled with gravel
  - Concrete slab poured over the gravel
  - Cinder blocks to build out the walls

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ Once the basement of the main extension is done, they'll need to regroup to dig the foundation for the mud room. There just wasn't enough room to do both at once. I'm sure it'll cost us more doing it this way, but there really was no other option.

</details>
<a href='#top'>Back to Top</a>

<div id='009'></div>

## Day 9 - 10/8/22

- Foundation guys arrived at 6:30am to put some finishing touches in before the concrete truck arrived
- 7:30am concrete truck arrived, got set up, and they started pouring
- 8am finished pouring and smooth out the concrete

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ There's a barrier in the far wall of the foundation where the concrete is higher on one side than the other. Not sure why, but it looks very intentional. Might ask Ted at some point.

<div id='010'></div>

## Day 10 - 11/8/22

- Arrived early to strip the wooden boards off of the now dried concrete
- Removed the larger rocks from inside the foundation area in preparation for the gravel
- Made the ramp to the pit longer and less steep
- Filled the outer walls with gravel and packed it down

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ Tomorrow they'll start building up the basement walls. Once it's about 1/3rd complete, they'll pour the concrete slab for the floor, then continue with the walls. Doing it that way saves having to rent a pump truck for the concrete, which saves us about $2k.

</details>

## Day 11 - 15/8/22

- Delivered 6 loads of concrete blocks for the foundation walls
- Dropped off some gear

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ It's felt like ages since any progress was made, but in reality it's been about 3 and a half days, 2 of which were the weekend. Probably unresonable for me to feel eager for things to keep moving. I spoke to Ted, and he was optimistic that things would be finished by Thanksgiving. If that's the case, I'll be very happy.

## Day 15 - 22/8/22

- Inspector came by to give the go ahead for pouring the slab

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ Spoke to Ted about what we want to do regarding the finish of the basement. We'll go with a polished concrete floor (i.e. nothing special), and paint the cinderblock walls. We still need to ask if we can do surface mounted electrical outlets. 

It sounds like they're not going to backfill around the foundation until the first floor framing is done, which is a bit of a pain. It would be nice to regain easy access to our back lawn while the weather is nice so that Bodie can play back there again.

## Day 16 - 24/8/22

- The team arrived before 7am to get ready for the concrete truck
- Concrete truck arrived soon after
- Poured the slab and smoothed it out
- Gone by 8:15am

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_ Will continue finishing the walls of the foundation tomorrow, including boxing in the bilco door area. Fingers crossed we'll have a finished basement by the end of the day. There's still an open wall of dirt between the new basement floor and the bottom of the old foundation. Unsure what they're going to do with that, but I'd assume they'll seal it up and cover it with concrete at some point? Time will tell.

## Day 18 - 26/8/22

- Sealed the outside of the basement walls with concrete
- Started building the interior wall which will bring the extension basement floor up to the level of the current foundation
- Started building up the remaining walls, leaving a gap to get in and out
- Scaffolding equipment arrived so they can finish the full height easily

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

_Jackson:_  I'm always off when I guess they're going to finish something. I probably have unrealistically high expectations for how quickly this stuff can be done.
