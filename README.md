## Pre-start date

- Digger delivered
- Patio stones removed
- Fence/gate removed

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>
This was done while we were out in St Louis. Strange to come back and have a segment of the fence just removed, with all the patio stones simply gone. The fence/gate parts were pushed to the back of the property to reuse later. Boden loved playing in the dirt though.

They ripped up the asphalt on the driveway, tore down the side entrance steps, and leveled the area that used to be the backyard patio. Big piles of debris; a mountain of broken earth & rocks are left to be scooped up.

Using the digger, they scoop the asphalt debris into a large dump that was delivered at 8am. There's a lot of dust and we're sneezing.
