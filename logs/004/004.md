## Day 4 - 4/8/22

- Continued digging, and finished the hole for the main extension
- They'll tidy that, and have the foundation poured and then move on to digging for the mud room, since there's not enough space to do them concurrently
- Discovered the old well to the house
- Ripped out the step just outside the basement door
- We showed our neighbours around the pit

_Jackson:_ Arrived at 7:15am, got started soon after. A lot of the same today. Were told we have to have money available for the foundation guy on monday, cash. Paying cash gives us a good discount.
