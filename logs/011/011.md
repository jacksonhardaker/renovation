_Jackson:_ It's felt like ages since any progress was made, but in reality it's been about 3 and a half days, 2 of which were the weekend. Probably unresonable for me to feel eager for things to keep moving. I spoke to Ted, and he was optimistic that things would be finished by Thanksgiving. If that's the case, I'll be very happy.
