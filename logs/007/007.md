_Jackson:_ I don't know anything about the templates, but it seems like they've boxed in the outer edges of the new extension, while leaving the base of the existing house alone. There must be a reason, but I don't know what. Maybe it's just not necessary?

_Natalie:_ Some big, beefy guys came and laid out wooden boards and metal rods for a mold of what looks like the base of our foundation and walls. Exciting to see the outline of the house!
