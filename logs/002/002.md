_Natalie:_ Using the digger, they scoop the asphalt debris into a large dump that was delivered at 8am. There's a lot of dust and we're sneezing. Over the course of the day, they demolished the basement Bilco door & stairs and created a large trough reaching back into the property. The boys stood in it at the end of the day and sides came up over Jackson's head.

_Jackson:_ There looks to be the reminants of an old ceramic drain pipe stretching the length of the hole. I wonder what it was for? There's so much dirt piled up it's hard to get to the back of our yard without clambering over things. After they finished for the day, we went out our basement door, which now sits about a meter above the bottom of the pit.
