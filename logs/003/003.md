_Jackson:_ The hole is **huge**. Started stressing out that it was representative of the eventual size of the extension, however it sounds like they're digging at least several feet extra in all directions. I guess it makes it easier to form the foundation. There was good news regarding the dirt dumping: Apparently the usually have to drive the truck all the way to Poughkeepsie to dump the dirt, however it just so happens that a local electrician who was working nearby needs a canyon on his property filled, so they only have to haul it there. Score!
