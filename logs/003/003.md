_Jackson:_ The hole is **huge**. Started stressing out that it was representative of the eventual size of the extension, however it sounds like they're digging at least several feet extra in all directions. I guess it makes it easier to form the foundation. There was good news regarding the dirt dumping: Apparently the usually have to drive the truck all the way to Poughkeepsie to dump the dirt, however it just so happens that a local electrician who was working nearby needs a canyon on his property filled, so they only have to haul it there. Score!

_Natalie:_ A big dump truck came at 7:30am and the digger immediately started to shovel the mountain of dirt into the dump: Big job. The shadow of the digger swept across the kitchen all morning. 2 man operation around 1pm.: one moving huge piles of dirt via front loader to the dump truck down the driveway while the other digs and digs in the back!
