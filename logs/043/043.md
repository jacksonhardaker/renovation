_Jackson:_ Staying in Newburgh SUCKED. First week we lost water due to a water main bursting, had the downstairs neighbor banging on the ceiling at 2am because he thought that Boden was running around in the apartment waking him up (not true, Boden and Natalie were visiting her parents), had ongoing issues with internet connectivity. Oh, and Bodie got sick with croup.
