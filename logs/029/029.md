_Jackson:_ Feels a bit weird having shipped off a bunch of dirt when the pit was being dug, only to have to order more to replace it when it was time to backfill. I don't think there was much else to be done. Too much dirt was removed, and we just don't have anywhere that it could have been stored until backfilling time. Felt sorry for the guys having to do it manually, but the excavator should be back on Friday (along with more dirt) to continue the job.
