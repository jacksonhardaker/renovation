## Day 18 - 26/8/22

- Sealed the outside of the basement walls with concrete
- Started building the interior wall which will bring the extension basement floor up to the level of the current foundation
- Started building up the remaining walls, leaving a gap to get in and out
- Scaffolding equipment arrived so they can finish the full height easily

_Jackson:_  I'm always off when I guess they're going to finish something. I probably have unrealistically high expectations for how quickly this stuff can be done.
