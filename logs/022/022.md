_Jackson:_ Determining where to drop the materials took a bit of manuvering for the delivery guy. The framers work quickly. Got started around lunch time and made short work of getting the floors installed. The plan is for it to be finished today so that tomorrow the bulldozer can come and backfill around the foundation walls, and make a start at digging the pit for the mud room foundation.
