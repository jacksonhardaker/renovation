_Jackson:_ This week felt good. Feeling like progress is being made at a good rate now. We were over on Wednesday and there were 5 different sets of contractors there working on different aspects of the house. Gives us hope that maybe the "ready in the next few weeks" for us to move back into the old part of the house might actually be reality.
