_Jackson:_ Fucking finally! Finalised the change of plans for the clearstory. It was going to be too imposing in the roof terrace space, not to mention it was positioned almost perfectly to block off the last of our neighbors view of the mountain. We felt bad about that. Ultimately replacing it with a skylight is a much better choice for both us _and_ our neighbors. I just wish we'd though of it before work began as it's definitely costing us more to change plans now.
