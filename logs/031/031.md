_Jackson:_ Expecting a bunch of activity next week. Backfilling should be complete. Mudroom foundation should be complete. Two of the windows in the current basement will be filled in with brick, since they intersect the mudroom.

We're hoping that we can retain a vent for the drier. Eventually we'll have a drier in the mudroom, but until that time, we still want to be able to use our existing one. There's also the danger of appliances being back ordered, so we may not be able to get new washer/drier into the mudroom right away.

They're also planning on blowing out the wall of the existing basement to connect it to the new basement next week. Exciting, but nerve-racking. It will be cool to be able to walk from basement to basement.
