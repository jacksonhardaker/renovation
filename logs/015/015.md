_Jackson:_ Spoke to Ted about what we want to do regarding the finish of the basement. We'll go with a polished concrete floor (i.e. nothing special), and paint the cinderblock walls. We still need to ask if we can do surface mounted electrical outlets. 

It sounds like they're not going to backfill around the foundation until the first floor framing is done, which is a bit of a pain. It would be nice to regain easy access to our back lawn while the weather is nice so that Bodie can play back there again.
