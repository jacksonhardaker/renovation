_Jackson:_ Will continue finishing the walls of the foundation tomorrow, including boxing in the bilco door area. Fingers crossed we'll have a finished basement by the end of the day. There's still an open wall of dirt between the new basement floor and the bottom of the old foundation. Unsure what they're going to do with that, but I'd assume they'll seal it up and cover it with concrete at some point? Time will tell.
