_Jackson:_ Bodie got quite sick over the weekend. He was low energy and cranky on Sunday, then on Monday he was a mess. I ended up sleeping on the couch next to his room for the next few nights as he was in frequent need of water and comforting because he couldn't really breath out of his nose well. Turns out it was RSV. Poor bugger getting croup and RSV within a couple of weeks of each other.

This marks the final week of our 6 week stay in Newburgh. The plan was to spend thanksgiving week in Pennsylvania with Natalie's family, however because of Bodie's RSV, the fact that Natalie and I were starting to come down with it, and that there would be several 80+ attendees at thanksgiving, that plan changed two days before we had to be out of Newburgh.

Faced with either extending another week in Newburgh, which I was strongly against due to being 100% _over_ being there (nor did I want to spend my week off in that space), we scrambled for find an alternative. The stars aligned and we found a place to stay in Montreal, so I'm writing these last few updates from there!

In theory, when we get back from Montreal the extension + house will be weather tight again!
